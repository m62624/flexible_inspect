# Requrements 

- Python at least version 3.7
- Dependencies are not required for this library, as all the necessary components and dependencies are already included. ( the `Rust` compiler provides static docking of all dependencies in the executable, making it independent of external libraries and the runtime environment.)
- Operating system requirements :

|                     | **Linux**                   | **Windows**               | **macOS**              |
