Now we can start writing the code. Let's start with importing

=== "Rust"

    ``` rust
    use flexible_inspect_rs::prelude::*;
    ```

=== "JavaScript/TypeScript"

    If you are using the **node** version

    ``` js
    import { Rule, MatchRequirement, Cartridge, TemplateValidator, init_logger, LogLevel } from "flexible_inspect_js_node";
    ```

    If you use the **web** version to work directly in the **browser** or using **webpack**. You must load the `wasm` file before using the library, using the `init()` function.

    ``` js
    import init {Rule, ...} from ...
    ```

=== "Python"

    ``` python
    from flexible_inspect_py import Cartridge, MatchRequirement, TemplateValidator, Rule
    ```

Next, let's look at the text for which validation will take place. It's just json-like pseudo-text mixed with plain text. Let's just say this is just a report on some kind of system test.

``` json
    { 
        v1: 1,
        SYSTEM DATA FOR TESTS
        { "report": {

            },
            {

              }
            },
      END OF SYSTEM DATA FOR TESTS
```

We'll validate for two errors

!!! abstract "Error 1"
    Check incorrect *tokens*, and get the first incorrect *token*.
!!! abstract "Error 2"
    Check in the `"Performance Testing"` body that the test was completed no later than **11:00**, (check the time if the test was successful)

To do this, we'll create two cartridges

=== "Rust"

    ``` rust
    // Cartridge for checking incorrect tokens received
    let found_broken_token = Cartridge::new(
        -10, // error code
        "Found a broken token {bd_tkn}",
        [Rule::new(
            "(?<bd_tkn>#BAD.TOKEN.MESSAGE.+?#)",
            MatchRequirement::MustNotBeFound,
        )],
    );
    /*
    check under `Performance Testing` that the end time must be earlier than 11 o'clock,
    check the time only if the result is successful
     */
    let long_performance_testing = Cartridge::new(
        1100, // error code
        "The test did not pass within the given time (before 11:00 hours)",
        [
            // get the body of Performance Testing
            Rule::new(
                r#"(?ms)"title":\s?"Performance Testing",\s.*\)"#,
                MatchRequirement::MustBeFound,
            )
            // Get the result from the root to this rule, we got the Performance Testing body,
            //  now check the result of the test
            .extend([Rule::new(
                r#"(?ms)"result":\s?"successful".+\)"#,
                MatchRequirement::MustNotBeFound,
            )
            // the time must be no later than 11:00
            .extend([Rule::new(
                r#""end_time": "(?:(?:0[0-9]|1[0-1]):[0-5][0-9])""#,
                MatchRequirement::MustBeFound,
            )])]),
        ],
    );
    ```

=== "JavaScript/TypeScript"

    !!! warning "`finish_build()`"

        One thing to remember in `JavaScript/TypeScript` is that the classes:
        `Cartridge`, `CartridgeBytes`, `Rule`, `RuleBytes` before sending them to any methods that accept these structures, you must specify `finish_build()`, this method prepares the structure to work in `Rust`.

        That is, you can initialize your variable, use various modifiers and at the end specify `finish_build()`, after that the structure cannot use its methods.

    ``` js
    // Cartridge for checking incorrect tokens received
    let found_broken_token = new Cartridge(
      -10, // error code
      "Found a broken token {bd_tkn}",
      [
        new Rule(
          String.raw`(?<bd_tkn>#BAD.TOKEN.MESSAGE.+?#)`,
          MatchRequirement.MustNotBeFound
        ).finish_build(),
      ]
    );
    /*
      check under `Performance Testing` that the end time must be earlier than 11 o'clock,
      check the time only if the result is successful
    */
    let long_performance_testing = new Cartridge(
      1100, // error code
      "The test did not pass within the given time (before 11:00 hours)",
      [
        // get the body of Performance Testing
        new Rule(
          String.raw`(?ms)"title":\s?"Performance Testing",\s.*\)`,
          MatchRequirement.MustBeFound
        )
          // Get the result from the root to this rule, we got the Performance Testing body,
          //  now check the result of the test
          .extend([
            new Rule(
              String.raw`(?ms)"result":\s?"successful".+\)`,
              MatchRequirement.MustNotBeFound
            )
              // the time must be no later than 11:00
              .extend([
                new Rule(
                  String.raw`"end_time": "(?: (?: 0[0 - 9] | 1[0 - 1]): [0 - 5][0 - 9])"`,
                  MatchRequirement.MustBeFound
                ).finish_build(),
              ])
              .finish_build(),
          ])
          .finish_build(),
      ]
    );
    ```

=== "Python"

    ``` python
    # Cartridge for checking incorrect tokens received
    found_broken_token = Cartridge(-10, "Found a broken token {bd_tkn}", [
        Rule(
        r"(?<bd_tkn>#BAD.TOKEN.MESSAGE.+?#)",
        MatchRequirement.MustNotBeFound,
        )]
    )

    # check under `Performance Testing` that the end time must be earlier than 11 o'clock,
    # check the time only if the result is successful
    long_performance_testing = Cartridge(
    1100,
    "The test did not pass within the given time (before 11:00 hours)",
    [
        # get the body of Performance Testing
        Rule(
            r'(?ms)"title":\s?"Performance Testing",\s.*\)',
            MatchRequirement.MustBeFound,
        )
        # Get the result from the root to this rule, we got the Performance Testing body,
        #  now check the result of the test
        .extend(
            [
                Rule(
                    r'(?ms)"result":\s?"successful".+\)',
                    MatchRequirement.MustNotBeFound,
                )
                # the time must be no later than 11:00
                .extend([Rule(
                        r'"end_time": "(?:(?:0[0-9]|1[0-1]):[0-5][0-9])"',
                        MatchRequirement.MustBeFound,
                        )
                ])
            ]
        ),
    ],
    )
    ```
So we've created two cartridges, we've specified rules inside that store regular expressions with modifiers
