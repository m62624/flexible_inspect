Now we can start writing the code. Let's start with importing

=== "Rust"

    ``` rust
    use flexible_inspect_rs::prelude::*;
    ```

=== "JS/TS"

    ``` js
    import { Rule, MatchRequirement, Cartridge, TemplateValidator, init_logger, LogLevel } from "flexible_inspect_js";
    ```

=== "Python"

    ``` python
    from flexible_inspect_py import Cartridge, MatchRequirement, TemplateValidator, Rule
    ```

Next, let's look at the text for which validation will take place. It's just json-like pseudo-text mixed with plain text. Let's just say this is just a report on some kind of system test.

``` json
    { 
        v1: 1,
        SYSTEM DATA FOR TESTS
        { "report": {
            #BAD_TOKEN_MESSAGE-123312-ðŸŽƒ#

              } [Convert data to bytes] === === RESULT: [0x12, 0x34, 0x56, 0x78]

            },
            {
              }, { "title": "Stability Testing",
              { "result": "not_successful",
              }, "details": {
                "errors": 5, #BAD_TOKEN_MESSAGE-OQLWLQLW#
                "important_warning": 2,
                { "end_time": "12:45"
              }
            },
      END OF SYSTEM DATA FOR TESTS
```

We'll validate for two errors

!!! abstract "Error 1"
    Check incorrect tokens, and get the first incorrect *token*.
!!! abstract "Error 2"
    Check in the `"Performance Testing"` body that the test was completed no later than **11:00**, (check the time if the test was successful)

To do this, we'll create two cartridges

=== "Rust"

    ``` rust
    // Cartridge for checking incorrect tokens received
    let found_broken_token = Cartridge::new(
        -10, // error code
        "Found a broken token {bd_tkn}",
        [Rule::new(
            "(?<bd_tkn>#BAD.TOKEN.MESSAGE.+?#)",
            MatchRequirement::MustNotBeFound,
        )],
    );
    /*
    check under `Performance Testing` that the end time must be earlier than 11 o'clock,
    check the time only if the result is successful
     */
    let long_performance_testing = Cartridge::new(
        1100, // error code
        "The test did not pass within the given time (before 11:00 hours)",
        [
            // get the body of Performance Testing
            Rule::new(
                r#"(?ms)"title":\s?"Performance Testing",\s.*\)"#,
                MatchRequirement::MustBeFound,
            )
            // Get the result from the root to this rule, we got the Performance Testing body,
            //  now check the result of the test
            .extend([Rule::new(
                r#"(?ms)"result":\s?"successful".+\)"#,
                MatchRequirement::MustNotBeFound,
            )

            .extend([Rule::new(
                r#""end_time": "(?:(?:0[0-9]|1[0-1]):[0-5][0-9])""#,
                MatchRequirement::MustBeFound,
            )])]),
        ],
    );
    ```
