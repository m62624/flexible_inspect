# Welcome to Pystval Docs

Here you will find all the information you need to know about the features, functions and usage of our library. We are happy to welcome you to our community and hope that this documentation will help you maximize your use of `Pystval`.


## What is Pystval?

With `Pystval` you can create universal validators that work with any text and fulfill specific requirements. Customize error behavior and apply sub-corrections based on specific cases or conditions. `Pystval` allows you to create accurate and adaptable validators for various text processing tasks.

The difference between this library and the usual use of regular expressions is that you can combine different rules with modifiers, and the results of these rules are automatically passed to subexpressions, etc.


`Regex` (Regular Expression) and `Pystval` (Python Simple Validation Library) are both tools for working with patterns and checking whether text conforms to certain rules. However, there are a few differences between the two.

### Implementation

Implementation: `Regex` is a standard library for working with regular expressions in many programming languages, including Python. It provides powerful pattern-based text retrieval and processing capabilities. On the other hand, `Pystval` is a specialized library for data validation in Python. It is designed specifically for easy and convenient data validation in applications.

### Abstraction Level

Abstraction Level: `Regex` works at the level of regular expressions, which are sequences of characters that define a pattern. It has a wide range of functions and operators to define complex patterns for text search and replacement. `Pystval`, on the other hand, provides a higher level of abstraction for data validation. It offers ready-made rules and functions for checking data types, value ranges, and other validation conditions.

### Finite state machines

Finite state machines: One of the key advantages of `Pystval` is the use of finite state machines. Finite state machines are models of computation that consist of states and transitions between them. `Pystval` uses finite state machines to validate data, allowing for more efficient and accurate pattern matching and validation conditions.

### Ease of Use
Ease of Use: `Pystval` is designed with a focus on ease of use. It offers a simple and intuitive API that makes it easy to define validation rules and validate data. With a higher level of abstraction and the use of finite automata, `Pystval` simplifies the data validation process and reduces the amount of code needed.
