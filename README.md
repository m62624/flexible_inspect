# About
The `Flexible_inspect` is a universal tool for checking the correctness of data in string and byte formats. 
It allows you to determine whether the data conforms to certain rules and provides the ability to find errors and inconsistencies.\
The project aims to create a versatile and flexible tool for validating data in different formats, ensuring accuracy, reliability and usability.

## Implementation
Implementation: Regex a formal language used in computer programs working with text to find and manipulate substrings in text,
based on the use of metacharacters It provides powerful pattern-based text search and manipulation capabilities.
On the other hand, `flexible_inspect` is a specialized library for data validation.
It's designed specifically for easy and convenient validation of data with varying degrees of nesting

## Abstraction Level
`Flexible_inspect` provides a higher level of abstraction for data validation.
It has a simple way for different nesting of regular expressions and also has the ability to change data validation modes

## Flexibility
Rust version customized for validator implementations for other programming languages

## Ease of use
Designed with an emphasis on ease of use. Offers a simple and intuitive `API` that makes it easy to define validation rules and validate data.
