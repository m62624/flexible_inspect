# Changelog


## [1.1.0] - 2023.07.19

### Added
- New static method `auto_generate` in `Rule` class. This method allows users to generate regular expressions based on given text input. This is especially useful for quick pattern prototyping. It takes a `MatchRequirement` and a list of strings as input and returns a `Rule` instance with a generated regular expression.

### Fixed
- Issue with the `matching mod`. The problem with `all_rules_for_all_matches` not allowing the upper stack to transition to other modes has been resolved.

### Changed
- For user convenience, all documentation from the `README`` file has been transferred to Read the Docs. Now, you can find comprehensive, neatly organized, and searchable project documentation at our [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pystval/) page.
